The reasons I made this program are:
  - to understand and apply basic systems like for loops, if/else and when/else.  
  - to get my feet wet creating functions to work with the main function 
  - to apply the concept of indexes in lists (I figured if I can understand and apply a 2D list I'd be capable of doing a 1D list)
  - to get a general idea of how to work with kotlin
  - because I like games
